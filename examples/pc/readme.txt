This configuration is meant as a "data-only" backup, and avoids backing up any binaries, libraries and the like; in case of a restore, you will have to re-download all your apps (though the exported list of packages/snaps/etc. should make that easier). Note that you may lose some configuration information or data, such as stateful docker containers or apps that store their configuration files in one of the excluded folders.
